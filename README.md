# Personal-Website
I made this site using stock images/resources and texts as a part of my ongoing exercise. On this page, I've tweaked a little with the image hover animations. I don't intend to make this page responsive anytime soon so it's a desktop-only site. For your convenience, refrain from opening it on mobile devices and view it as a desktop site.
